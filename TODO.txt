- objects created from `Context` should keep the context alive via `Arc`
  - otherwise behavior becomes *very* weird (things finish instantly, but seemingly still happen in
    the background?)
- canonicalize object construction pattern (parent object method vs. `fn new` that takes the parent)
- fix soundness
- consistently use either u16 or u32 for widths/heights
